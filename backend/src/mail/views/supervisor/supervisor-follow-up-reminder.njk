<p><span>What if I need to change my approval decision?</span></p>
<p>Selecting <span>APPROVE</span> for YOUR employeeâ€™s recommitment is a final action and cannot be undone. However, if you initially <span>DECLINED</span> their recommitment, you can only change it once before {{date}}. After this date, please reach out to  {{emcr_contact}} OR {{bcws_contact}} if you wish to re-approve this member.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for your ongoing support!</p>
