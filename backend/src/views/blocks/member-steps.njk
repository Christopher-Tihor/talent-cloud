<li>Once you have confirmed your return to CORE, your supervisor will be notified to give approval/decline your request. If your supervisor approves of your recommitment, your member status will be automatically updated to "Recommitted" for {{year}}. </li>

<p><span>If you plan to recommit to BCWS:</span></p>
<p>You can now directly fill in your PAR-Q+ response as part of the recommitment process in your dashboard. <span>Your PAR-Q+ responses will NOT be recorded; you must download your response once completed and email it to your Fire Centre.</span> If you have any concerns about your health conditions that may affect your deployment in the upcoming year, please inform your CORE coordinator.</p>

<p>To complete the PAR-Q+, <span>you must have a witness signature.</span> Please make sure you have found someone to be your witness before starting recommitment.</p>
