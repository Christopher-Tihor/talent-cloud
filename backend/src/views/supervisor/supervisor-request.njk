<p>Hello {{supervisor}},</p>

<p>The following employee has requested to recommit to the CORE Team program for {{year}}:</p>

{% include "blocks/member-program.njk" %}
 
As their supervisor, you have the authority to approve or decline their participation in CORE Team for the upcoming year.

<p>Please note that this email is simply requesting your approval for the memberâ€™s participation in CORE Team. Once they are recommitted, <span>supervisor approval is still required for each deployment. You are NOT obligated to approve every deployment just because you have given approval for recommitment.</span></p>
